# Copilot Instructions for Pirate Game Project

## Development Workflow

### Starting/Restarting the Game
- **ALWAYS use `./restart.sh`** to start or restart the pirate game
- This script handles proper cleanup and initialization
- Never manually run `python pirate_game.py` directly
- The restart script ensures clean state and proper port management

### Testing Changes
1. Make your code changes
2. Run `./restart.sh` to test
3. Wait for the server to start (look for "ðŸ“± Open http://localhost:8000")
4. Test functionality in browser at `http://localhost:8000`
5. Confirm changes work before making additional modifications

### Port Management
- The game uses port 8000 for the web interface
- The restart script automatically handles port conflicts
- If port issues occur, the restart script will clean them up

### Process Management
- Always use the restart script rather than killing processes manually
- The script handles proper cleanup of background processes
- If you need to stop the game, use Ctrl+C and then run `./restart.sh` for the next test

### Key Commands
- `./restart.sh` - Start/restart the game (primary command)
- `http://localhost:8000` - Access the web interface
- Ctrl+C - Stop the running game process

## Remember
**When the user asks to test changes or run the game, ALWAYS use `./restart.sh`**
