- âœ… Configured workspace mapping to enable live editing of HTML/CSS files
- âœ… Verified endpoint accessibility at `/.well-known/appspecific/com.chrome.devtools.json`
- âœ… Established development workflow for browser-based code editing

**Chrome DevTools Usage**: 
1. Run `./restart.sh` to start the web server
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
3. Open DevTools (F12) â†’ Sources tab
4. Click "Add folder to workspace" â†’ Select the project folder
5. Allow Chrome to access the folder when prompted
6. Edit HTML/CSS directly in DevTools Sources panel - changes save automatically to files

### 2024-12-19 - Frontend Refactoring and Separation of Concerns
- âœ… Renamed `web_frontend.html` to `index.html` for standard web conventions
- âœ… Extracted all CSS styles into separate `styles.css` file
- âœ… Updated web server routing to serve `index.html` as default page
- âœ… Improved maintainability with proper separation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- âœ… Verified Chrome DevTools workspace compatibility with new file structure
- âœ… GUI integration tested and working

### 2024-12-19 - ARM64 Architecture Compatibility
- âœ… Resolved ARM64 package conflicts with numpy, pydantic-core, and zstandard
- âœ… Used --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir to get native ARM64 packages
- âœ… Verified package architecture compatibility (macosx_11_0_arm64.whl)
- âœ… Updated VS Code terminal configuration for proper bash profile loading
- âœ… Fixed ollama PATH issues in virtual environment activation
