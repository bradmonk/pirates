# Development Log - Pirate Game AI Agent System

## Project Overview
- **Goal**: 2D turn-based pirate game played by AI agents using LangGraph
- **Architecture**: Python with LangGraph, LangChain, and local Ollama integration
- **Map System**: CSV-based 30x30 grid with Water, Land, Treasure, Enemies, Monsters
- **AI Agents**: Navigator (scanning), Cannoneer (combat), Captain (strategy/movement)

### 2024-12-19 - GUI Visualization System
- âœ… Created `gui_display.py` using matplotlib for real-time visualization
- âœ… Implemented color-coded map display (blue=water, brown=land, gold=treasure, red=enemies, purple=monsters)
- âœ… Added ship position tracking and status information display
- âœ… Created update mechanism for real-time game state visualization
- âœ… GUI integration tested and working

### 2024-12-19 - ARM64 Architecture Compatibility
- âœ… Resolved ARM64 package conflicts with numpy, pydantic-core, and zstandard
- âœ… Used --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir to get native ARM64 packages
- âœ… Verified package architecture compatibility (macosx_11_0_arm64.whl)
