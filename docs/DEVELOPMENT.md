# Development Progress

## Latest Updates

### 2024-XX-XX - LangGraph Agent Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

**BREAKTHROUGH SESSION: Complete LangGraph tool calling implementation**

#### Major Accomplishments:
1. **üéØ Fixed 400 Error**: Resolved "messages with role 'tool' must be a response to a preceding message with 'tool_calls'" by implementing isolated agent message contexts
2. **ü§ñ Complete Agent Workflow**: Navigator ‚Üí Cannoneer ‚Üí Captain all working with proper LangGraph tool calling
3. **‚öîÔ∏è Tool Integration**: All three agents (Navigator, Cannoneer, Captain) successfully using bind_tools() with OpenAI models
4. **üèóÔ∏è Proper Architecture**: Full LangGraph StateGraph with conditional edges, ToolNodes, and result handlers

#### Technical Implementation:
- **File**: `langgraph_agents.py` - Complete rewrite using proper LangGraph patterns
- **Key Pattern**: Each agent gets fresh [system_message, human_message] context to prevent tool message conflicts
- **Agent Communication**: Via formatted reports in `state["agent_reports"]` instead of raw message passing
- **Tool Calling**: Using `llm.bind_tools([tool_list])` with OpenAI models (Ollama doesn't support bind_tools)

#### Test Results:
```
‚úÖ Navigator: Scans environment and generates tactical report
‚úÖ Cannoneer: Processes targets and executes cannon fire
‚úÖ Captain: Analyzes crew reports and makes strategic movement decisions
‚úÖ All agents working with proper LangGraph tool calling - NO MORE 400 ERRORS!
```

#### What This Enables:
- Proper AI agent workflow with tool calling
- Scalable LangGraph architecture for future agent additions
- Clean separation of concerns between navigation, combat, and movement
- Foundation for complete game automation

#### Next Steps:
- Minor bug fixes (cannon fire parameter issue)
- Integration with web GUI for real-time agent visualization
- Performance optimization and error handling improvements
