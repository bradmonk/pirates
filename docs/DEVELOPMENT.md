## Project Overview
- **Goal**: 2D turn-based pirate game played by AI agents using LangGraph
- **Architecture**: Python with LangGraph, LangChain, and local Ollama integration
- **Map System**: CSV-based 30x30 grid with Water, Land, Treasure, Enemies, Monsters
- **AI Agents**: Navigator (scanning), Cannoneer (combat), Captain (strategy/movement)

## Recent Major Updates

### 2024-12-23 - Turn Counter Synchronization Fix ✅
- ✅ **Unified Turn Counting**: Fixed dual turn counter issue where game loop counter and game state counter were out of sync
- ✅ **Accurate Game End Detection**: Moved turn counting from move_ship() method to main game loop for proper synchronization
- ✅ **Improved End Game Logic**: Enhanced end-game summary to use actual turn count and proper exit reason detection
- ✅ **Eliminated Turn Mismatch**: Resolved confusion where "TIME LIMIT" was incorrectly reported due to counter desynchronization
- ✅ **Better Game Flow Tracking**: Main game loop now maintains authoritative turn count synchronized with game state

### 2024-12-23 - Realistic Line-of-Sight Scanning ✅
- ✅ **Line-of-Sight Implementation**: Navigator can no longer see through land masses - only items with clear sight lines are detected
- ✅ **Bresenham-like Algorithm**: Added `has_line_of_sight()` method using stepping algorithm to check for land obstacles
- ✅ **Realistic Reconnaissance**: Treasures, enemies, and monsters behind land formations are now hidden from scanner
- ✅ **Enhanced Tactical Realism**: Players must navigate around land masses to reveal hidden areas and items
- ✅ **Strategic Exploration**: Encourages more realistic scouting and positioning strategies

### 2024-12-23 - Simplified Captain Interface & Navigator Recommendations ✅
- ✅ **Simplified Movement Options**: Removed redundant AVAILABLE MOVES section from Captain's briefing to reduce information overload
- ✅ **Cleaner Blocked Moves**: Simplified blocked move format from "@1N (1 miles North): Blocked - Path blocked by L at (9, 12)" to "1 miles North is blocked"
- ✅ **Navigator Directive**: Updated Navigator system prompt to provide single movement recommendation in @XY format (e.g., @2N, @3W)
- ✅ **Reduced Captain Confusion**: Streamlined strategic context to focus on essential information and clear recommendations
- ✅ **Enhanced Decision Flow**: Navigator now ends reports with specific directional guidance for Captain to follow

### 2024-12-23 - Enhanced Directional Reporting & Navigator Clarity ✅
- ✅ **Cleaner Direction Format**: Simplified Navigator reporting to show only directional components without redundant total distance
- ✅ **Natural Language Enhancement**: Improved readability with "2 miles north and 1 mile east (2N + 1E)" format instead of confusing "total miles" display
- ✅ **Navigator Intelligence**: Eliminated confusion between Manhattan distance totals and actual positional components
- ✅ **Consistent Formatting**: Standardized location reporting across treasures, enemies, and monsters for better AI comprehension
- ✅ **Code Optimization**: Streamlined format_location_details() function to produce clearer, more actionable intelligence reports

### 2024-12-23 - Directional Reporting Fix & Scan Radius Revert ✅
- ✅ **Directional Component Display**: Fixed direction reporting to show actual displacement components (e.g., "5N + 5E") instead of primary direction only
- ✅ **Scan Radius Revert**: Reverted scan radius back to original square area behavior (radius 5 = 11x11 square) instead of Manhattan distance constraint
- ✅ **Distance Accuracy**: Maintained Manhattan distance calculation for movement and combat while using proper directional components for navigation
- ✅ **UI Format Update**: Updated agent formatting to display "X miles total (YN + ZE)" format for clearer positional intelligence
- ✅ **Code Optimization**: Simplified `get_surrounding_cells()` method in `game_state.py` and enhanced `get_direction()` in `game_tools.py`

- ✅ **Status API Extension**: Enhanced game status API to include total enemy counts for UI display

### 2024-12-19 - System Prompt Centralization & Cannon Range Fix ✅
- ✅ **System Prompt Centralization**: Created `system_prompts.py` to eliminate duplicate system prompt definitions across files
- ✅ **Cannon Range Correction**: Fixed discrepancy where system prompts stated 2-tile range but game logic supported 5-tile probabilistic system
- ✅ **Updated Game Tools**: Modified `game_tools.py` to correctly implement 5-tile cannon range with distance-based hit probabilities (1-tile: 95%, 2-tile: 90%, 3-tile: 75%, 4-tile: 50%, 5-tile: 25%)
- ✅ **Centralized Configuration**: All agent system prompts now reference single source in `SYSTEM_PROMPTS` dictionary
- ✅ **Import Fixes**: Resolved LangChain import issues (`ToolExecutor` → `ToolNode`, added missing `Optional`, `SystemMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `END`)
- ✅ **Dependency Resolution**: Installed missing `langchain-community` package
- ✅ **System Validation**: Successfully tested updated system with centralized prompts and correct cannon mechanics

### 2024-12-19 - Enhanced Collision Detection System ✅
